scalable
low latency
distributed
publish subscribe over topics
at least once delivery
offset management for subscribers
data replication

applications are tenants
topic, message, throuput and storage scales by just adding more servers

tenants can administer, manage and monitor their domains

made of many clusters
a cluster is made of brokers, bookkeepers and a zookeeper

broker serves thousands of topics
topic is assigned to a broker
broker commits messages to a bookkeeper
brokers cache data to avoid disk reads

bookkeeper is a distributed write ahead log system
pulsar creates multiple logs called ledgers
bookkeeper hosts called bookies handle thousands of ledgers with reads and writes
scales incapacity and throughtput as more bookies incraease them

bookies use seperate disks
one for the journal and one for storage
this isolates latency of ongoing write operations
read and write decoupled
a big difference 

managed ledger is a data stream with a single writer and many readers
each reader has their own cursor, the offset
managed ledger uses many bookeeper ledgers to store data

uses zookeeper
for coordinating topic assignments among brokers

load balancer on brokers distributes data among brokers

topics created when needed and deleted when not
subscriptions persist until deleted

a very low latency
