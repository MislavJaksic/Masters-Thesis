In this model, data does not take the form of persistent relations, but rather arrives in multiple, continuous, rapid, time-varying data streams.  In addition to reviewing past work relevant to data stream systems and current projects in the area, the paper explores topics in stream query languages, new requirements and challenges in query processing, and algorithmic issues.}
